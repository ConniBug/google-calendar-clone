**Project is still in development.** 
I'll be periodically updating the documentation and would like to have it done within three weeks. Note that what I've provided in ./dist is purely for development/viewing. The production build will be a fraction of the size.

**Viewing**
For now, you can view the app through screenshots (link below), or simply download the repo and open `./dist/testbundle.html` in your browser (or any live server extension). I will host on github pages shortly.
